# usage :
to use the tool you need to install the `requirements`
to do this run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `python main.py`.   
To start using the tool you need to learn how to use it :   
- ### one how to Encrypt a message: 
    - Run `python main.py -en "true" -m "<yourMessage>"`: the `-en` is used to tell the tool that you want to encrypt a message. `true` for Encrypt and `false` for Decrypt. and the `-m` is used to set the message which you want to Encrypt. After the tool is finished it will display to you the `key` and the `encrypt message`. NOTE: Save the key, you will need it when you want to decrypt the same message.
- ### two how to Decrypt a message:
    - Run `python main.py -en "false" -em "<EncryptMessage>" -k "<Key>" `: the `-em` is used to set the encrypt message which you want to decrypt. the `-k` is used to set the key of the encrypt-message.

## The Errors:
there is three types of errors in the tool: 
- The First Type `Error in The Third-Part Libraries`: 
    - The Tool will take care of that.
- The Second Type `Error in The Tool Files`:
    - To fix the error you need to delete and install the tool from the beginning.
- The Third Type `Decrypt Error`:
    - to fix that make sure you are setting the correct `encrypt message` and the correct `key`.
